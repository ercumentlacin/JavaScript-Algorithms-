| [01 - isConsecutive](https://github.com/ercumentlacin/JavaScript-Algorithms-/tree/main/01-%20isConsecutive)                              | a function that will return true if a given string (divided and grouped into a size) will contain a set of consecutive numbers (regardless of orientation: whether ascending or descending), otherwise, return false.                                                              |
| [02 - MatrixTranspose](https://github.com/ercumentlacin/JavaScript-Algorithms-/tree/main/MatrixTranspose)                                | In linear algebra, the transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal; that is, it switches the row and column indices of the matrix A by producing another matrix, often denoted by A^T.                                                             |
| [03 - Determinant](https://github.com/ercumentlacin/JavaScript-Algorithms-/tree/main/03%20-%20Determinant)                               | In linear algebra, the determinant is a scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix and encodes certain properties of the linear transformation described by the matrix.                                                                                |
| [04 - Basic Arithmetic Operations](https://github.com/ercumentlacin/JavaScript-Algorithms-/tree/main/04%20-%20BasicArithmeticOperations) | function that does the following for the given values: add, subtract, divide and multiply . This is simply referred to as the basic arithmetic operations.                                                                                                                         |
| [05 - ASCII Capitals](https://github.com/ercumentlacin/JavaScript-Algorithms-/tree/main/05%20-%20ASCIICapitals)                          | function that converts any word in a given sentence to upper case if the sum of the ASCII codes of the letters in the word is greater than the global average for the sentence. The global average of a sentence is the sum of all the word values divided by the number of words. |
